# this script asks the user for one IGSN, then builds a table showing how that sample and all related samples are connected.
# the pandas library helps create and display tables of data.

#I think the issue with too many API calls happens in the function build_hierarchy_table 
# because it is fetching data for each child sample to find its children
#  but some of those child samples may have already been fetched when we climbed up the parent chain
# there has to be a more optimized way to build the table without fetching the same sample multiple times
